# About Me
Hi, I'm Weronika. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Game Design, which started my passion for game and software development. Currently, I am continuing my education with two majors: Software Tester and Java Developer Web. I have been involved in software testing for a while now and want to develop my skills in this specific direction. I am quick to learn new things and am open to the challenges of changing career paths. I love to work in a team and find myself easily in different environments, which allows me to work effectively with other professionals. My main goal is to develop my knowledge and technical skills in the testing field.
